# About

I grew up in Brigham City, Utah, a small town near the Idaho border with rounded, brownish mountains on one side and marshes on the other. Some facts about Brigham City: it has a steakhouse that raises its own buffalo, it grows some good peaches, and it's named after a prominent 19th century polygamist.

I earned a bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. I decided to switch to computer science after realizing that I wasn't about to solve any of the remaining problems in physics. I'm currently a CS graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; if you want to know more about that, read [my CV](/assets/cv.pdf).

As of 2019 I'm married to the lovely Itzel Estrella, who has taught me many things I would not have thought to teach myself. We have a leopard gecko named Monty who has only bitten me once.

I enjoy spending time outdoors: downhill skiing in the winter and hiking in the summer. I like simple, well-made things and people who work to make the world better without expecting to be praised. I care a great deal about sustainability and human rights; if you do too, let's have a conversation.

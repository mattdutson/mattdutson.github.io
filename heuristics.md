# Heuristics

Some good rules of thumb, given roughly in order of importance. This list is expected to grow as I continue to learn things.

1. Don't waste time solving the wrong problem well.[^1]
2. Simplicity is its own utility.
3. Optimize the common case.
4. When creating something, start with an outline.
5. Books are best for learning ideas.
6. The internet is best for learning technologies.
7. Not everything is an object.[^2]
8. Only consider machine learning after classical methods fail.[^3]
9. Learn to write LaTeX.
10. Don't try to format LaTeX.[^4]

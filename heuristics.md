# Heuristics

Some good rules of thumb, given roughly in order of importance. This list is expected to grow as I continue to learn things.

1. "Why," then "what," then "how."[^1]
2. Keep things simple,
3. but allow complexity when it yields significant utility.
4. Optimize the common case.
5. When creating something, start with an outline or sketch.
6. Books are best for learning ideas.
7. The internet is best for learning technologies.
8. Not everything is an object.[^2]
9. Only consider machine learning after classical methods fail.[^3]
10. Learn to write LaTeX.
11. Don't try to format LaTeX.[^4]

## Footnotes

[^1]: Another way to say this is, "don't waste time solving the wrong problem well" (credit to Michael Gleicher that particular phrasing).
[^2]: I am referring to object-oriented programming, although there may be some metaphysical truth to this.
[^3]: Follows from (2) and (3).
[^4]: Does not hold for professional typographers.

# Heuristics

Some good rules of thumb, given roughly in order of importance. This list is expected to grow as I continue to learn things.

1. Don't waste time solving the wrong problem well.[^1]
2. Keep things simple,
3. but allow complexity when it yields significant utility.
4. Not everything is an object.[^2]
5. Books are best for learning ideas.
6. The internet is best for learning technologies.
7. Only consider machine learning after classical methods fail.[^3]
8. Learn to write LaTeX.
9. Don't try to format LaTeX.[^4]

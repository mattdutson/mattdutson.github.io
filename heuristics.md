Some good rules of thumb, given roughly in order of importance. This list is expected to grow as I continue to learn things.

1. Don't waste time solving the wrong problem well.[^1]
2. Know your audience.[^2]
3. Simplicity is its own utility.
4. Before starting a project, create an outline or sketch.
5. Optimize the common case.
6. Use books to learn concepts.
7. Use the internet to learn technologies.
8. Effective communication requires deliberate effort.
9. Your PowerPoint slides are not your talk.
10. Not everything is an object.[^3]
11. Only consider machine learning after classical methods fail.[^4]
12. Learn to write LaTeX.
13. Don't try to format LaTeX.[^5]

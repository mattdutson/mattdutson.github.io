    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>Since 2018 I've been a student in the computer science MS/PhD program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My interests include computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning. Since fall 2019 I've been advised by Mohit Gupta. My current research is on single-photon sensing and neuromorphic computing.</p>
    
    <p>I believe that computer science has great potential to improve the human condition. Unfortunately, technology can also concentrate power and threaten democratic institutions. I choose to conduct my work in a way that is consistent with principles of democracy, privacy, and human rights.</p>

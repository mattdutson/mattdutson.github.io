    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>Since 2018 I've been a student in the computer science MS/PhD program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My interests are broadly in computer vision, graphics, and machine learning. During the 2018-2019 academic year I was jointly advised by Jignesh Patel and Kevin Eliceiri. Starting in the fall of 2019 I'll be working with Mohit Gupta.</p>
    
    <p>In 2018 I graduated magnum cum laude from the University of Utah with an honors B.S. in physics. The topic of my thesis was <a href="http://www.telescopearray.org/images/papers/theses/Dutson_Thesis.pdf">Reconstruction of Cosmic Ray Geometry Using Cherenkov Backscattering</a>, supervised by Douglas Bergman.</p>
    
    <p>As far as programming languages, I'm most comfortable with C++, Python, Java, and Rust. I'm also familiar with C, C#, Perl, and JavaScript.</p>
    
    <p>Aside from the enjoyment I derive from its practice, my enthusiasm for computer science comes from its potential to improve the human condition. Unfortunately, technology can also concentrate power and threaten democratic institutions. I choose to conduct my work in a way that aligns with principles of democracy, privacy, sustainability, and respect for human rights.</p>

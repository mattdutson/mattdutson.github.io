    <h2>Statement</h2>

    <p>Since 2018 I've been a student in the computer science MS/PhD program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My interests are broadly in computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning. Since fall 2019 I have been advised by Mohit Gupta. I'm currently conducting research in neuromorphic sensing and computing.</p>
      
    <p>In 2018 I graduated magnum cum laude from the University of Utah with an honors BS in physics. The topic of my thesis was <a href="/assets/utah_thesis.pdf">Reconstruction of Cosmic Ray Geometry Using Cherenkov Backscattering</a>, supervised by Douglas Bergman.</p>
    
    <p>Aside from the enjoyment I derive from its practice, my enthusiasm for computer science comes from its potential to improve the human condition. Unfortunately, technology can also concentrate power and threaten democratic institutions. I choose to conduct my work in a way that aligns with principles of democracy, privacy, sustainability, and respect for human rights.</p>

## Summary

Since 2018 I've been a student in the computer science PhD program at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison. My interests are broadly in computer vision,
graphics, and databases. I am jointly advised by [Jignesh
Patel](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jignesh/) and [Kevin
Eliceiri](https://loci.wisc.edu/people/kevin-eliceiri). In 2018 I received a
bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Utah.

Aside from the enjoyment I derive from its practice, my enthusiasm for computer
science is motivated by its potential to bring prosperity and improve the human
condition. Unfortunately, technology can also concentrate power and threaten
democratic institutions. I choose to conduct my work in a way that aligns with
principles of democracy, privacy, environmentalism, and respect for human
rights.

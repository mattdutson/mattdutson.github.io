## Summary

Since 2018 I've been a student in the computer science PhD program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My interests are broadly in computer vision, graphics, and databases. I am jointly advised by [Jignesh Patel](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jignesh/) and [Kevin Eliceiri](https://loci.wisc.edu/people/kevin-eliceiri).

In 2018 I graduated magnum cum laude from the University of Utah with an honors B.S. in physics. I completed minors in mathematics and computer science. The topic of my thesis was [Reconstruction of Cosmic Ray Geometry Using Cherenkov Backscattering](http://www.telescopearray.org/images/papers/theses/Dutson_Thesis.pdf), conducted under the supervision of [Douglas Bergman](http://www.physics.utah.edu/~bergman/).

Aside from the enjoyment I derive from its practice, my enthusiasm for computer science is motivated by its potential to bring prosperity and improve the human condition. Unfortunately, technology can also concentrate power and threaten democratic institutions. I choose to conduct my work in a way that aligns with principles of democracy, privacy, environmentalism, and respect for human rights.

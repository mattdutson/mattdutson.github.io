## Summary

Since 2018 I've been a student in the computer science PhD program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am currently advised by [Jignesh Patel](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jignesh/). In 2018 I received a bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Utah.

My interests are broadly in machine learning, computer vision, and graphics. Over the past year I have also developed a peripheral interest in databases.

Aside from the enjoyment I derive from its practice, my enthusiasm for computer science is motivated by its potential to improve prosperity and the human condition. Unfortunately, technology can also concentrate power and threaten democratic institutions. I choose to conduct my work in a way that aligns with principles of democracy, privacy, environmentalism, and respect for human rights.

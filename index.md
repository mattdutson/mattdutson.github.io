## Summary

Since 2018 I've been a student in the computer science MS/PhD program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My interests are broadly in computer vision and graphics. During the 2018-2019 academic year I was jointly advised by [Jignesh Patel](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jignesh/) and [Kevin Eliceiri](https://loci.wisc.edu/people/kevin-eliceiri). Starting in the fall of 2019 I'll be working with [Mohit Gupta](http://wisionlab.cs.wisc.edu/people/mohit-gupta/).

In 2018 I graduated magnum cum laude from the University of Utah with an honors B.S. in physics. The topic of my thesis was [Reconstruction of Cosmic Ray Geometry Using Cherenkov Backscattering](http://www.telescopearray.org/images/papers/theses/Dutson_Thesis.pdf), supervised by [Douglas Bergman](http://www.physics.utah.edu/~bergman/).

As far as programming languages, I'm most comfortable with [C++](https://github.com/mattdutson/cherenkov-simulator), [Python](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/mattdutson/e533bad6932f6c12e02d54f07ea07b45), Java, and [Rust](https://github.com/UWHustle/hustle). I'm also familiar with C, C#, Perl, and JavaScript.

Aside from the enjoyment I derive from its practice, my enthusiasm for computer science comes from its potential to improve the human condition. Unfortunately, technology can also concentrate power and threaten democratic institutions. I choose to conduct my work in a way that aligns with principles of democracy, privacy, sustainability, and respect for human rights.

Finally, as if there weren't enough hyperlinks on this page, here's one to [my resume](assets/resume.pdf).
